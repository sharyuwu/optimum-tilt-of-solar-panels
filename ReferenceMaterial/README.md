# References Folder

This folder contains the papers and presentations cited throughout the course.  Each paper has a file and a corresponding BiBTeX entry in the `References.bib` file.  For the most part the file names and the citation labels are the same.  They are mostly consistent with the AuthorYear style of citations (https://www.e-education.psu.edu/styleforstudents/c5_p11.html)
