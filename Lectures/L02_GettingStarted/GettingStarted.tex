\frametitle{Git, GitLab and GitHub}
\begin{itemize}
\item Git manages changes to documents
\bi
\item Tracks changes
\item Keeps history, you can roll back
\item Useful documentation over time
\item Allows people to work simultaneously
\ei
\item Benefits for SC \cite{WilsonEtAl2016}
\bi
\item Not necessary to make a backup copy of everything, stores just enough
  information to recreate
\item Do not need to come up with names for backup copies - same file name, but
  with timestamps
\item Enforces changelog discipline
\item Facilitates identifying conflict and merging changes
\ei
\item The real bottleneck in scientific computing~\cite{Wilson2006}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Git Typical Usage}

First either init repo or clone (git init, git clone), then typical workflow is
\be
\item update repo (git pull)
\item create files
\item stage changes to be committed (git status, git add)
\item commit staged changes (git commit -m ``message'')
\item push to remote, if using one (git push)
\ee
\bi
\item Commit after every separate issue, and when need to stop working
\item Always include a meaningful and descriptive commit message for the log
\item If a push reveals conflicts, take appropriate action to merge

\frametitle{SE For SC Literature}

\begin {itemize}

\item CAS 741 process is document driven, adapted
from the waterfall model~\cite{GhezziEtAl2003, VanVliet2000}
\item Many say a document driven process is not used by, nor suitable for,
scientific software.
\bi
\item Scientific developers naturally use an agile
  philosophy~\cite{AckroydEtAl2008, CarverEtAl2007, EasterbrookAndJohns2009, Segal2005}, 
\item or an amethododical process~\cite{Kelly2013}
\item or a knowledge acquisition driven process~\cite{Kelly2015}.
\ei
\item Scientists do not view rigid, process-heavy approaches,
  favorably~\cite{CarverEtAl2007}
\item Reports for each stage of development are counterproductive~\cite[p.~373]{Roache1998}
\item Up-front requirements are
impossible~\cite{CarverEtAl2007, SegalAndMorris2008}
\item \structure{What are some arguments in favour of a rational document driven
    process?}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Counter Arguments}

\begin {itemize}

\item Just because not used, doesn't mean docs shouldn't be
\item Documentation provides many
benefits~\cite{Parnas2010}: 
\bi
\item easier reuse of old designs
\item better communication about requirements
\item more useful design reviews
\item easier integration of separately
written modules
\item more effective code inspection
\item more effective testing
\item more efficient corrections and improvements.
\ei
\item Actually faking a rational design process
\item Too complex for up-front requirements sounds like an excuse
\bi
\item Laws of physics/science slow to change
\item Often simple design patterns
\item Think program family, not individual member
\ei
\item Debunking myth against up-front requirements~\cite{SmithEtAl2019}
