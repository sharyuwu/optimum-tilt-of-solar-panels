\frametitle{Example Modules from SWHS}

\textbf{Hardware Hiding Modules}

\begin{description}
\item[Secrets:] The data structure and algorithm used to implement the virtual
  hardware.
\item[Services:] Serves as a virtual hardware used by the rest of the
  system. This module provides the interface between the hardware and the
  software. So, the system can use it to display outputs or to accept inputs.
\item[Implemented By:] OS
\end{description}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Example Modules from SWHS}

\textbf{Input Parameters Module}

\begin{description}
\item[Secrets:] The data structure for input parameters, how the
values are input and how the values are verified.  The load and verify secrets
are isolated to their own access programs (like submodules). %    This, combined
% with the fact that all of the services are invoked together, suggests that the
% one module one secret rule can be relaxed here.
\item[Services:] Gets input from user (including material properties, processing
  conditions, and numerical parameters), stores input and verifies that the
  input parameters comply with physical and software constraints. Throws an
  error if a parameter violates a physical constraint. Throws a warning if a
  parameter violates a software constraint.  % Stored parameters can be read
  % individually, but write access is only to redefine the entire set of inputs.
\item[Implemented By:] SWHS
\end{description}

\textbf{ODE Solver Module}

\begin{description}
\item[Secrets:] The algorithm to solve a system of first order ODEs initial
  value problem from a given starting time until the given event function shows
  termination.
\item[Services:] Solves an ODE using the governing equation, initial
  conditions, event function and numerical parameters.
\item[Implemented By:] Matlab

\begin{itemize}

\item Scaffolding needed to create the environment in which the module should be

\frametitle{Integration Testing}

\begin{itemize}
\item Big-bang approach
\begin{itemize}
\item First test individual modules in isolation
\item Then test integrated system
\end{itemize}
\item Incremental approach
\begin{itemize}
\item Modules are progressively integrated and tested
\item Can proceed both top-down and bottom-up according to the USES relation
\end{itemize}

\item Case 1
\begin{itemize}
\item Test $M_1$ providing a stub for $M_2$ and a driver for $M_1$
\item Then provide an implementation for $M_{2,1}$ and a stub for $M_{2,2}$
\end{itemize}
\item Case 2
\begin{itemize}
\item Implement $M_{2,2}$ and test it by using a driver
\item Implement $M_{2,1}$ and test the combination of $M_{2,1}$ and $M_{2,2}$
  (i.e.\ $M_2$) by using a driver
\item Finally implement $M_1$ and test it with $M_2$ using a driver for $M_1$

\frametitle{Overview of MIS}
\begin{itemize}
\item See Hoffman and Strooper \cite{HoffmanAndStrooper1995}
\item The MIS precisely specifies the modules observable behaviour - what the module does
\item The MIS does not specify the internal design
\item The idea of an MIS is inspired by the principles of software engineering
\item Advantages
\begin{itemize}
\item Improves many software qualities
\item Programmers can work in parallel
\item Assumptions about how the code will be used are recorded
\item Test cases can be decided on early, and they benefit from a clear specification of the behaviour
\item A well designed and documented MIS is easier to read and understand than complex code
\item Can use the interface without understanding details
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Overview of MIS}
\begin{itemize}
\item Options for specifying an MIS
\begin{itemize}
\item Trace specification
\item Pre and post conditions specification
\item Input/output specification
\item \structure{Before/after specification - module state machine}
\item Algebraic specification
\end{itemize}
\item Best to follow a template
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\item State variables
\item State invariants

\item Access routine semantics

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{MIS Uses Section}
\begin{itemize}
\item Specify imported constants
\item Specify imported types
\item Specify imported access programs
\item The specification of one module will often depend on using the interface specified by another module
\item When there are many modules the uses information is very useful for navigation of the documentation
\item Documents the use relation between modules
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{MIS Syntax Section}
\begin{itemize}
\item Specify exported constants
\item Specify exported types
\item Specify access routine names, the input and output parameter types and exceptions
\item Show access routines in tabular form
\begin{itemize}
\item Important design decisions are made at this point
\item The goal is to have the syntax match many implementation languages

\frametitle{MIS Semantics Section}

\begin{itemize}
\item State variables
\begin{itemize}
\item Give state variable(s) name and type
\item State variables define the state space
\item If a module has state then it will have ``memory''
\end{itemize}
\item State invariant
\begin{itemize}
\item A predicate on the state space that restricts the ``legal'' states of the module
\item After every access routine call, the state should satisfy the invariant
\item Cannot have a state invariant without state variables
\item Just stating the invariant does not ``enforce'' it, the access routine semantics need to maintain it
\item Useful for understandabilty, testing and for proof
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Exception Signaling}

\begin{itemize}
\item Useful to think about exceptions in the design process
\item Will need to decide how exception signalling will be done
\begin{itemize}
\item A special return value, a special status parameter, a global variable
\item Invoking an exception procedure
\item Using built-in language constructs
\end{itemize}
\item Caused by errors made by programmers, not by users
\item Write code so that it avoid exceptions
\item Exceptions will be particularly useful during testing
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Assumptions versus Exceptions}

\begin{itemize}
\item The assumptions section lists assumptions the module developer is permitted to make about the programmer's behaviour
\item Assumptions are expressed in prose
\item Use assumptions to simplify the MIS and to reduce the complexity of the final implementation
\item Interface design should provide the programmer with a means to check so that they can avoid exceptions
\item When an exceptions occurs no state transitions should take place, any output is {\it don't care}
\end{itemize}
