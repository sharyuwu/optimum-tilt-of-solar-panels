%   incorrect transactions
% \item Manual Support: Determines that the manual support procedures are documented and complete, where manual support
% involves procedures, interfaces between people and the system, and training procedures

\item \structure{A test case t is an element of D or R?}
\item \structure{A test set T is a finite subset of D or R?}
\item \structure{How would we define whether a test is successful?}
\item \structure{How would we define whether a test set is successful?}

\item Test set T: A finite subset of D
\item Test is successful if P(t) is correct
\item Test set successful if P correct for all t in T
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Theoretical Foundations of Testing}

\begin{itemize}
\item Desire a test set $T$ that is a finite subset of $D$ that will uncover all errors
\item Determining and ideal $T$ leads to several
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem}{undecideable
    problems}
\item No algorithm exists:
\bi
\item To state if a test set will uncover all possible errors
\item To derive a test set that would prove program correctness
\item To determine whether suitable input exists to guarantee execution of a
  given statement in a given program
\item etc.
\ei
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Empirical Testing}

\begin{itemize}
\item Need to introduce empirical testing principles and heuristics as a
  compromise between the impossible and the inadequate
\item Find a strategy to select \structure{significant} test cases
\item Significant means the test cases have a high potential of uncovering the
  presence of errors
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Complete-Coverage Principle}

\begin{itemize}
\item Try to group elements of $D$ into subdomains $D_1$, $D_2$, ..., $D_n$
  where any element of each $D_i$ is likely to have similar behaviour
\item $D = D_1 \cup D_2 \cup ... \cup D_n$
\item Select one test as a representative of the subdomain
\item If $D_j \cap D_k = \emptyset$ for all $j \neq k$, (partition), any element
  can be chosen from each subdomain
\item Otherwise choose representatives to minimize number of tests, yet
  fulfilling the principle
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{White-box Testing}

\begin{itemize}
\item \structure{Intuitively, after running your test suites, what percentage of
    the lines of code in your program should be exercised?}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{White-box Coverage Testing}

\begin{itemize}
\item (In)adequacy criteria - if significant parts of the program structure are not tested, testing is inadequate
\item Control flow coverage criteria
\begin{itemize}
\item Statement coverage
\item Edge coverage
\item Condition coverage
\item Path coverage
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Examples that follow are from \cite{GhezziEtAl2003}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Statement-Coverage Criterion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Select a test set $T$ such that every elementary statement in $P$ is
  executed at least once by some $d$ in $T$
\item An input datum executes many statements - try to minimize the number of
  test cases still preserving the desired coverage
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Edge-Coverage Criterion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Select a test set $T$ such that every edge (branch) of the control flow is
  exercised at least once by some $d$ in $T$
\item This requires formalizing the concept of the control graph and how to construct it
\begin{itemize}
\item Edges represent statements
\item Nodes at the ends of an edge represent entry into the statement and exit
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Condition-Coverage Criterion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Select a test set $T$ such that every edge of $P$'s control flow is traversed and all possible values of the
constituents of compound conditions are exercised at least once
\item This criterion is finer than edge coverage

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Path-Coverage Criterion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Select a test set $T$ that traverses all paths from the initial to the final node of $P$s control flow
\item It is finer than the previous kinds of coverage
\item However, number of paths may be too large, or even infinite (see while loops)
\item Loops
\begin{itemize}
\item Zero times (or minimum number of times)
\item Maximum times
\item Average number of times
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Infeasibility Problem}

\begin{itemize}
\item Syntactically indicated behaviours (statements, edges, etc.) are often impossible
\item Unreachable code, infeasible edges, paths, etc.
\item Adequacy criteria may be impossible to satisfy
\begin{itemize}
\item Manual justification for omitting each impossible test case
\item Adequacy ``scores'' based on coverage - example 95 \% statement coverage
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Further Problem}

\begin{itemize}
\item What if the code omits the implementation of some part of the specification?
\item White box test cases derived from the code will ignore that part of the specification!
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Testing Boundary Conditions}

\begin{itemize}

\item Testing criteria partition input domain in classes, assuming that behavior
  is ``similar'' for all data within a class
\item Some typical programming errors, however, just happen to be at the
  boundary between different classes
\begin{itemize}
\item Off by one errors
\item $<$ instead of $\leq$
\item equals zero
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Criterion}

\begin{itemize}

\item After partitioning the input domain D into several classes, test the
  program using input values not only ``inside'' the classes, but also at their
  boundaries
\item This applies to both white-box and black-box techniques
\item In practice, use the different testing criteria in combinations
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Oracle Problem}

\structure{When might it be difficult to know the ``expected''
  output/behaviour?}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Oracle Problem}

\begin{itemize}

\item Given input test cases that cover the domain, what are the expected
  outputs?
\item Oracles are required at each stage of testing to tell us what the right
  answer is
\item Black-box criteria are better than white-box for building test oracles
\item Automated test oracles are required for running large amounts of tests
\item Oracles are difficult to design - no universal recipe
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}

\item Using an independent program to approximate the oracle (pseudo oracle)
\item Method of manufactured solutions

  output
