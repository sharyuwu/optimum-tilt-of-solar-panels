\frametitle{Summary of Template}
\begin{itemize}
\item Quality is a concern for scientific computing software
\item Software engineering methodologies can help
\item Motivated, justified and illustrated a method of writing requirements specification for engineering computation
to improve reliability
\item Also improve quality with respect to usability, verifiability, maintainability, reusability and portability
\item Tabular expressions to reduce ambiguity, encourage systematic approach
\item Conclusions can be generalized because other computation problems follow the same pattern of \emph{Input} then
\emph{Calculate} then \emph{Output}
\item Benefits of approach should increase as the number of details and the number of people involved increase

\frametitle{Program Families}

\begin{itemize}

\item Can think of general purpose (or multi-purpose) SC software as a program
  family
\item Some examples of physical models are also appropriate for consideration as
  a family
\item A program family is a set of programs where it makes more sense to develop
  them together as opposed to separately
\item Analogous to families in other domains
\begin{itemize}
\item Automobiles
\item Computers
\item ...
\end{itemize}
\item Need to identify the commonalities
\item Need to identify the variabilities
\item Discussed in general in \cite{ClementsAndNorthrop2001,PohlEtAl2005}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Background}

\begin{itemize}

\item Program family idea since the 1970s (Dijkstra, Parnas, Weiss, Pohl, ...) - variabilities are often from a finite
set of simple options \cite{Parnas1976, Parnas1979, Dijkstra1972}
\item Families of algorithms and code generation in SC (Carette, ATLAS, Blitz++, ...) - not much emphasis on
requirements \cite{Carette2006, WhaleyEtAl2001, Veldhuizen1998, Blitz2010}
%\item Problem Solving Environments (PSEs)
\item Work on requirements for SC
\begin{itemize}
\item Template for a single physical model \cite{SmithEtAl2007, SmithAndLai2005}
\item Template for a family of multi-purpose tool \cite{Smith2006,
    SmithAndChen2004, SmithAndChen2004b}
\item Template for a family of physical models
  \cite{SmithMcCutchanAndCarette2017, SmithEtAl2008, McCutchan2007}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Motivation}
%:Improve Quality of Product and Process
\begin{itemize}

\item Requirements documentation
\begin{itemize}
\item Allows judgement of quality %need to know what require, 
\item Improves communication
\begin{itemize}
\item Between domain experts% and domain experts %missing models etc.
\item Between domain experts and programmers %experts on num algos
\item Explicit assumptions
\item Range of applicability
%\item Tradeoffs between nonfunctional requirements %ends arguments about best, 
% need to know what is most imp, might not need same accuracy for every aspect of the problem
\end{itemize}
%\item Provides a foundation for incremental delivery
\end{itemize}

\item A family approach, potentially including a DSL to allow generation of specialized programs
\begin{itemize}
\item Improves efficiency of product and process
\item Facilitates reuse of requirements and design, which improves reliability
\item Improves usability and learnability%DSL
%\item Improves learnability for non-experts %DSL
\item Clarifies the state of the art
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Advantages of Program Families to SC?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Usual benefits
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduced development time
\item Improved quality
\item Reduced maintenance effort
\item Increased ability to cope with complexity
\end{itemize}
\item Reusability
\begin{itemize}
\item Underused potential for reuse in SC
\item Reuse commonalities
\item Systematically handle variabilities
\end{itemize}
\item Usability
\begin{itemize}
\item Documentation often lacking in SC
\item Documentation part of program family methodology
\item Create family members that are only as general purpose as necessary
\end{itemize}
\item Improved performance
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Is SC Suited to a Program Family Approach?}

Based on criteria from Weiss \cite{ArdisAndWeiss1997, Weiss1997, Weiss1998,
  CukaAndWeiss1997,WeissAndLai1999}
\begin{itemize}
\item The redevelopment hypothesis
\begin{itemize}
\item A significant portion of requirements, design and code should be common between family members
\item Common model of software development in SC is to rework an existing program
\item Progress is made by removing assumptions
\end{itemize}

\item The oracle hypothesis
\begin{itemize}
\item Likely changes should be predictable
\item Literature on SC, example systems, mathematics
\end{itemize}

\item The organizational hypothesis
\begin{itemize}
\item Design so that predicted changes can be made independently
\item Tight coupling between data structures and algorithms
\item Need a suitable abstraction
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\frametitle{Challenges}

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\value{temp}}
\item Validatable
\begin{itemize}
\item Requirements can be complete, consistent, traceable and unambiguous, but still not validatable
\item Input and outputs are continuously valued variables
%\item Examples continuously valued variables: time, velocity, temperature, displacement, concentration, stress, etc.
%\item Infinite number of inputs and outputs
\item Correct solution is unknown a priori %difficult to have a test oracle
\item Given $dy/dt = f(t, y)$ and $y(t_0) = y_0$, find $y(t_n)$ 
%, where $y(t)$ is a function ($y:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow 
%\mathbb{R}$), $f(t,y)$ is a function ($f:\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$), $t$ is an independent
%variable (often time), $t_0$ is an initial value for $t$ and $t_n$ is the final value for $t$
%\item For arbitrary $f(t, y)$ the true solution is unknown, correct value is often not known a priori
%\item Same problem with $Ax = b$
%\item $\int e^{x^2} dx$
%\item Passing one test does not imply passing a nearby test
\end{itemize}
\item Abstract
\begin{itemize}
% \item Not difficult to be abstract
\item If too abstract, then difficult to meet NFRs for accuracy and speed
\item Assumptions can help restrict scope, but possibly as much work as solving the original problem
\begin{itemize}
\item $A x = b$
\item $x^T A x > 0, \forall x$
\end{itemize}
%say output should be solution, or say cannot compute, possibly with a reason
\item Algorithm selection should occur at the design stage

\frametitle{Challenges (Continued)}

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\value{temp}}
\item Nonfunctional requirements
\begin{itemize}
\item Proving accuracy requirements with a priori error analysis is a difficult mathematical exercise that generally
leads to weak error bounds
% mention Wilkinson
\item Context sensitive tradeoffs between NFRs can be difficult to specify
\item Absolute quantitative requirements are often unrealistic
% make the point about relative requirements elsewhere
\end{itemize}
\item Capture and Reuse Existing Knowledge
\begin{itemize}
\item Cannot ignore the enormous wealth of information that currently exists %not a green field development
\item A good design will often involve integrating existing software libraries
\item Reuse software and the requirements documentation
% scientific software is stable
