\frametitle{Scientific Computing (SC)}

\begin{itemize}

\item Scientific computation consists of using computer tools to simulate
  mathematical models of real world systems so that we can better understand and
  predict the systemâ€™s behaviour.
\item Examples
\bi
\item Temperature of fuel-pin in nuclear reactor
\item Flow of pollutant in groundwater
\item Displacement of a structure
\item Thickness of cast film
\item Temperature of water in a solar water heating tank over time
\item Ordinary Differential Equation solver
\item Root finding solver etc.
\ei
\item Includes analysis, design and ``exploration'' % point made by Isobel and Alex P

\frametitle{Software Engineering (SE)}

\begin{itemize}
\item SE is an area of engineering that deals with the development of software
  systems that
\begin{itemize}
\item Are large or complex
\item Exist in multiple versions
\item Exist for large period of time
\item Are continuously being modified
\item Are built by teams
\end{itemize}
\item SE is ``application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to
  the development, operation and maintenance of software'' (IEEE 1990)
\item D.\ Parnas (1978) defines SE as ``multi-person
  construction of multi-version software''
\item Like other areas of engineering, SE relies heavily on
  mathematical techniques (logic and discrete math)
\item SE might be applied to SC for software certification
\end{itemize}
