\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Correctness Versus Reliability Versus Robustness}

What is the difference between these 3 qualities?\\
~\\
Can you assess correctness without a requirements specification?

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Correctness}

\begin{itemize}
\item A software product is correct if it satisfies its requirements specification
\item Correctness is extremely difficult to achieve because
\begin{itemize}
\item The requirements specification may be imprecise, ambiguous, inconsistent,
  based on incorrect knowledge, or nonexistent
\item Requirements often compete with each other
\item It is virtually impossible to produce ``bug-free'' software
\item It is very difficult to verify or measure correctness
\end{itemize}
\item If the requirements specification is formal, correctness can in theory and
  possibly in practise be
\begin{itemize}
\item Mathematically defined
\item Proven by mathematical proof
\item Disproven by counterexample
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Reliability}

\begin{itemize}
\item A software product is reliable if it usually does what is intended to do
\item Correctness is an absolute quality, while reliability is a relative quality
\item A software product can be both reliable and incorrect
\item Reliability can be statistically measured
\item Software products are usually much less reliable than other engineering
  products
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Robustness}

\begin{itemize}
\item A software product is robust if it behaves reasonably even in
  unanticipated or exceptional situations
% example of saving a file and power is lost
\item A correct software product need not be robust
\begin{itemize}
\item Correctness is accomplished by satisfying requirements
\item Robustness is accomplished by satisfying unstated requirements
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Question on Correctness. Reliability and Robustness}

Reliable programs are a superset of correct programs AND robust programs are a
superset of reliable programs.  Is this statement True or False?
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
\item True
\item False %answer - robust programs may or may not be correct or reliable
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Performance}

What are some ways you could measure software performance?\\
~\\
What are some ways you could specify performance requirements to make them
unambiguous and verifiable?

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Performance}

\begin{itemize}
\item The performance of a computer product is the efficiency with which the
  product uses its resources (memory, time, communication)
\item Performance can be evaluated in three ways
\begin{itemize}
\item Empirical measurement
\item Analysis of an analytic model
\item Analysis of a simulation model
\end{itemize}
\item Poor performance often adversely affects the usability and scalability of
  the product
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Usability}

\structure{What are some examples of excellent usability?}\\
~\\
\structure{When you visit a hotel, especially in another country, do you expect
  some confusion with operating the shower?}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Usability}

\begin{itemize}
\item The usability of a software product is the ease with which a typical human
  user can use the product
\item Usability depends strongly on the capabilities and preferences of the user
\item The user interface of a software product is usually the principle factor
  affecting the product's usability
\item Human computer interaction (HCI) is a major interdisciplinary subject
  concerned with understanding and improving interaction between humans and
  computers
\end{itemize}
% talk about IBM usability lab and other things that Muir mentioned
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Verifiability}

\begin{itemize}
\item The verifiability of a software product is the ease with which the
  product's properties (such as correctness and performance) can be verified
\item Verifiability can be both an internal and an external quality
%\item What is the relationship between verifiability and correctness?
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Productivity}

\begin{itemize}
\item 
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Maintainability}

\begin{itemize}
\item The maintainability of a software product is the ease with which the
  product can be modified after its initial release
\item Maintenance costs can exceed 60\% of the total cost of the software product
\item There are three main categories of software maintenance
\begin{enumerate}
\item Corrective: Modifications to fix residual and introduced errors
\item Adaptive: Modifications to handle changes in the environment in which the product is used
\item Perfective: Modifications to improve the qualities of the software
\end{enumerate}
\item Software maintenance can be divided into two separate qualities
\begin{enumerate}
\item Repairability: The ability to correct defects
\item Evolvability: The ability to improve the software and to keep it current
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Maintainability}

What do software developers do to promote maintainability?

% documentation, traceability, separation of concerns, modularity, design for
% change, design for generality

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Reusability}

\structure{What are the advantages of reusing code?}\\
~\\
\structure{Why doesn't it happen more often?}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Reusability}

\begin{itemize}
\item A software product or component is reusable if it can be used to create a
  new product
\item Reuse comes in two forms
\begin{enumerate}
\item Standardized, interchangeable parts
\item Generic, instantiable components
\end{enumerate}
\item Reusability is a bigger challenge in software engineering than in other
  areas of engineering
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Portability}

\begin{itemize}
\item A software product is portable if it can run in different environments
\item The environment for a software product includes the hardware platform, the
  operating system, the supporting software and the user base
\item Since environments are constantly changing, portability is often crucial
  to the success of a software product
\item Some software such as operating systems and compilers, is inherently
  machine specific
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Understandability}

\begin{itemize}
\item The understandability of a software product is the ease with which the
  requirements, design, implementation, documentation, etc. can be understood
\item Understandability is an internal quality that has an impact on other
  qualities such as verifiability, maintainability, and reusability
\item There is often a tension between understandability and the performance of
  a software product
\item Some useful software products completely lack understandability
  (e.g. those for which the source code is lost)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Reproducibility}

\begin{itemize}
\item The cornerstone of the scientific method~\cite{Davison2012}
\item QA has, ``a bad name among creative scientists and
  engineers''~\cite[p.~352]{Roache1998}, but participating in QA also improves reproducibility
\item Reproducibility benefits from a consistent and repeatable
  computing environment, version control and separating code from
  configuration/parameters~\cite{Davison2012}
\item Historically not well done for SCS
\item Need for action is highlighted by a study of 402 computer systems papers -
  only 48.3\% of the code was both available and compilable
  \cite{CollbergEtAl2015}.
\item \cite{CrickAndHall2014} point out potential roadblocks for
  reproducibility, including page length constraints and differing detail needs
  depending on the audience
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Reproducibility}

\begin{itemize}
\item Interest is growing \cite{BenureauAndRougier2017, BaileyEtAl2016}
\item Progress on re-running old code with docker, VMs
\item Replicability is rarely achieved, as shown for microarray gene expression
  \cite{IoannidisEtAl2009} and for economics modelling
  \cite{IonescuAndJansson2013}
\item Long way to go to replicability from original theory
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Sustainability}

\item Seems to mean maintainability + productivity
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Relationship between Qualities}

Draw a diagram showing the relationships between the various software qualities

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Measurement of Quality}

\begin{itemize}
\item A software quality is only important if it can be measured - without
  measurement there is no basis for claiming improvement
\item A software quality must be precisely defined before it can be measured
\item Most software qualities do not have universally accepted
\item Can you directly measure maintainability?
\item How might you measure maintainability?
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{SRS versus CA}

\begin{itemize}
\item SRS (Software Requirements Specification)
\begin{itemize}
\item Requirements for a software product
\item Usually for specific physical problems
\end{itemize}
\item CA (Commonality Analysis)
\begin{itemize}
\item Requirements for a family of related software products
\item Sometime for specific physical problems
