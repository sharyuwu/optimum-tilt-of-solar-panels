\bi
\item Hopefully motivated assurance cases for SC
\item Quality is improved by looking at a problem from different perspectives,
  assurance cases provide a systematic and rigorous way to introduce a new
  perspective
\item An assurance cases will likely use the same documentation and ideas used
  in CAS 741
\item However, an assurance case can focus and direct efforts right from the
  start of the project
